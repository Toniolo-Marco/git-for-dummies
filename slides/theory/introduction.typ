[Git is the *most widely used distributed versioning system*. It is used to manage and track changes to source code in software development projects. 

It is an *essential* tool *for coordinating work between several developers*, keeping a *history* of the changes made. In this way, we avoid having several scattered versions of our project: _‘final’ ‘final-final’ ‘last-final-version’_ etc...

You will no longer have to spam ctrl+Z to go back to previous versions.],

  Git is based on a mechanism called Git's _"three trees"_:  #footnote(["Trees" may be a misnomer, as they are not strictly traditional tree data-structures and most commits have only one successor.])
  
  
  - *Working Directory*: This tree is in sync with the local filesystem and is representative of the immediate changes made to content in files.
  
  - *Staging index*: This tree is tracking Working Directory changes, that have been promoted (*staged*), it is a caching mechanism.
  
  - *Commit history*: It's a tree, with one root, where each branch is composed of commits: nodes that represent a _permanent_ snapshot in the project.
